                For my A Level coursework I created a cycling tracker windows forms program using VisualBasic.NET The charity bike ride I completed 
                in 2016 was the inspiration for this program. The system that I made aimed to act as a client version of current systems such as strava.com. 
                The system was designed to allow the user to enter all their past bike ride data which can then be compared against itself and other user's data. 
                If I had more time on this project I would have stored all the information on an external database rather than within text files on the user's 
                computer. The time limitation meant that the comparisons with other users was quite limited and every time the user was on a new computer their 
                information would have to be re-entered into the system. If this was a larger scale project then the larger aims could've been accomplished. 
                I have achieved a provisional grade A* for this project, and the code can be found on my
