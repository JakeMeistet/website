                I am an outgoing, approachable, enthusiastic, confident, self-motivated student and employee. I have recently achieved A-level Computer Science, 
                Psychology and Maths. I am currently studying for a BSc in Software Engineering at the University of Portsmouth.

                                <p class="about">
                                    As a committed individual, taking pride in my 100% commitment to any task or interest. 
                                    An example of this is that I have been raising money for charity from a very young age. In 2016, after 2 years of training, 
                                    I cycled from Land’s End in Cornwall to John o’ Groats in Scotland, completing a total of 999 miles in 12 consecutive days. 
                                    I successfully raised £7300 for three individual charities, Autoimmune Alopecia Research UK, Birmingham Children’s Hospital and Sandwell Young Carers. 
                                    In addition, I set up a blog for the whole event and for the training attracting interest from BBC Midlands Today. 
                                    There have been many other cycle events that I have completed, such as including Birmingham Bikeathon for Leukaemia and 
                                    cycling for men’s cancer when I was 6 years of age, and I have raised money with family in other events, for example, Macmillan Cancer Support.<br><br>

                                    In 2020 I completed my A-Levels with a set of high grades, which are detailed below. During college, I was nominated and voted for as the 
                                    Students' Union Secretary, demonstrating my leadership, negotiation and teamwork skills.<br><br>

                                    In Year 10, I completed the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Level Award, which included volunteer work and doing continuous activity and 
                                    pursuing my further interests. The Award also included several expeditions.<br><br>

                            <p class="about">
                                In 2018 I completed my GCSEs with a set of very high grades ranging from graded 8-5. Aged 15 I successfully applied for and 
                                completed a prefect role at my school. In Year 10 I completed the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Level Award, When involved I committed 
                                to volunteer work as well as doing a continuous activity and pursuing my interests further. The Award also included an 
                                expedition as well as two training expeditions where I further developed my team and leadership skills.<br><br>

                                I also have a passion for music where I have achieved up to Grade 4 music theory, grade 3 piano and grade 5 alto saxophone. 
                                I am currently working towards grade 6 on the alto saxophone which I hope to complete after my A-Levels have finished.
