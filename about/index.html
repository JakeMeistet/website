                I am an outgoing, approachable, enthusiastic, confident, self-motivated student and employee, currently studying 
                A level Computer Science, Maths and Psychology at NSCG Stafford College.

                            <p class="about">
                                As a committed individual, I have always taken pride of my 100% commitment to any task or interest I may have. 
                                An example of this is, from a very young age I have been a cycling enthusiast. In 2016, after 2 years of training, 
                                I cycled from Land’s End in Cornwall to John o’ Groats in Scotland completing a total of 999 miles in 12 consecutive 
                                days (an average of 85 miles a day). I successfully raised a total of £7298.81 money for three individual charities 
                                (Autoimmune Alopecia Research UK, Birmingham Children’s Hospital and Sandwell Young Carers).<br><br>

                                I also set up a blog for the whole event and the training. BBC Midlands Today also featured me around the time I was 
                                starting and finishing the cycle ride. I have participated in other cycle events including 2014 Birmingham Bikeathon 
                                for leukaemia (aged 12), and cycling for men’s cancer (aged 6). I have raised money with family including Macmillan Cancer Support.<br><br>
                                
                                During the lockdown of COVID-19, I have also been volunteering at the local foodbank in Cannock. When I'm in I manage all the parcel
                                requests sent in and prepare the necessary boxes for delivery. I update an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of all the parcels processed
                                through the foodbank as well as stating when the parcels left the warehouse to be delivered. If there is less parcels in a day I also help around
                                the warehouse, preparing packages and sorting through donations made.

                            <p class="about">
                                In 2018 I completed my GCSEs with a set of very high grades ranging from graded 8-5. Aged 15 I successfully applied for and 
                                completed a prefect role at my school. In Year 10 I completed the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Level Award, When involved I committed 
                                to volunteer work as well as doing a continuous activity and pursuing my interests further. The Award also included an 
                                expedition as well as two training expeditions where I further developed my team and leadership skills.<br><br>

                                I also have a passion for music where I have achieved up to Grade 4 music theory, grade 3 piano and grade 5 alto saxophone. 
                                I am currently working towards grade 6 on the alto saxophone which I hope to complete after my A-Levels have finished.
